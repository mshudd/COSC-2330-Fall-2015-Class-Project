COSC 2330 002 Fall 2015 Class Project 
Design and planning meeting

Meeting date: November 3 2015

	A planning and design discussion was held. During the discussion a change was 
	proposed to the color scheme. We discussed adding the color orange as a table indicator. 
	The proposed use of this action would be for the kitchen to designate that a tableâ€™s food 
	order was complete and ready for delivery.  The group as a whole felt that this would add 
	functionality to the program. This proposed change would make the whole process more efficient.

The group discussed the general layout for the program. There will be five groups with in the program. 
Host, Server, Kitchen, Busser, and Manager.  Each group will be a class with in the program. 
Log in credentials will be required for different levels of access to the system. 
The Manager group will have administrator rights. 

Danny and Julie will be responsible for programming the Host, Busser, and Kitchen groups.

Shane and Kevin will be responsible for programming the Server and Manager groups.

Whether to use forms or not was discussed. Forms will be utilized in the program. 

Tiffany, Mike, and Josh will be responsible for programming and design of the forms.

Richard will be responsible for programming the database and database access for the program.
